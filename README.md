This is a practice project to get bettet at the `streamlit` python library. It is created while following the [Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblQe2CCWqV4Zy3LY01Z8aF1&index=8) video available on the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) Youtube Channel.

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a future reference for myself.
